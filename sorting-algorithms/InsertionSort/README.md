# Insertion Sort

## Challenge
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time: O(n^2), Space: O(1)
