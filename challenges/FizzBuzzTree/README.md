# FizzBuzz Tree

## Challenge
Traverse a tree and when a value of divisible, by 3, 5 or both appears, output "fizz", "buzz", or "fizzbuzz", respectively, to the console.

## Approach & Efficiency
We are using a preorder traversal and containing the logic for the values inside the recursive method.
BigO: Time: O(n) Space: O(H), H = Height of tree, or call stack
