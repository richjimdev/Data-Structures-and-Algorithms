# Stack and Queue

## What is it
Create Stack, Queue, and Node classes to implement these data structures, including all needed methods for data manipulation.
A stack adds and removes nodes to the top of the list and allows you to also view that top node.
A queue adds nodes to a list like a chain and removes the oldest node first (the first added node).

## Use Examples
A stack would be best used for when handling a lot of data that we only want to handle one thing at a time, as we only care about the top node.
A queue would be used for data that needs to be handled in an orderly fashion, as things are exectued in the order that they were added.
