# Hashtables

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable that takes in a Key and Value and creates a node, hashes the Key and adds it to the Hashtable internal array.
Include: Add functionality, Find, and Contains, as well as a GetHash that creates the hash key

## Approach & Efficiency
Find() Big O(1), O(n) on linked list case
Add() Big O(1)
Contains() O(1), O(n) on linked list case
GetHash() O(1)
